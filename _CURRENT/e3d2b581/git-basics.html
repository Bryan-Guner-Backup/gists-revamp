<h2 id="add-commit">add &amp; commit</h2>
<p>You can propose changes (add it to the <strong>Index</strong>) using<br />
<code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code><br />
<code>git add *</code><br />
This is the first step in the basic git workflow. To actually commit these changes use<br />
<code>git commit -m "Commit message"</code><br />
Now the file is committed to the <strong>HEAD</strong>, but not in your remote repository yet.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-changes">pushing changes</h2>
<p>Your changes are now in the <strong>HEAD</strong> of your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute<br />
<code>git push origin master</code><br />
Change <em>master</em> to whatever branch you want to push your changes to.</p>
<p>If you have not cloned an existing repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with<br />
<code>git remote add origin &lt;server&gt;</code><br />
Now you are able to push your changes to the selected remote server</p>
<h2 id="branching">branching</h2>
<p>Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The <em>master</em> branch is the “default” branch when you create a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion.</p>
<p><img src="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/img/branches.png" /></p>
<p>create a new branch named “feature_x” and switch to it using<br />
<code>git checkout -b feature_x</code><br />
switch back to master<br />
<code>git checkout master</code><br />
and delete the branch again<br />
<code>git branch -d feature_x</code><br />
a branch is <em>not available to others</em> unless you push the branch to your remote repository<br />
<code>git push origin &lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="update-merge">update &amp; merge</h2>
<p>to update your local repository to the newest commit, execute<br />
<code>git pull</code><br />
in your working directory to <em>fetch</em> and <em>merge</em> remote changes.<br />
to merge another branch into your active branch (e.g. master), use<br />
<code>git merge &lt;branch&gt;</code><br />
in both cases git tries to auto-merge changes. Unfortunately, this is not always possible and results in <em>conflicts</em>. You are responsible to merge those <em>conflicts</em> manually by editing the files shown by git. After changing, you need to mark them as merged with<br />
<code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code><br />
before merging changes, you can also preview them by using<br />
<code>git diff &lt;source_branch&gt; &lt;target_branch&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="tagging">tagging</h2>
<p>it’s recommended to create tags for software releases. this is a known concept, which also exists in SVN. You can create a new tag named <em>1.0.0</em> by executing<br />
<code>git tag 1.0.0 1b2e1d63ff</code><br />
the <em>1b2e1d63ff</em> stands for the first 10 characters of the commit id you want to reference with your tag. You can get the commit id by looking at the…</p>
<h2 id="log">log</h2>
<p>in its simplest form, you can study repository history using.. <code>git log</code><br />
You can add a lot of parameters to make the log look like what you want. To see only the commits of a certain author:<br />
<code>git log --author=bob</code><br />
To see a very compressed log where each commit is one line:<br />
<code>git log --pretty=oneline</code><br />
Or maybe you want to see an ASCII art tree of all the branches, decorated with the names of tags and branches:<br />
<code>git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all</code><br />
See only which files have changed:<br />
<code>git log --name-status</code><br />
These are just a few of the possible parameters you can use. For more, see <code>git log --help</code></p>
<h2 id="replace-local-changes">replace local changes</h2>
<p>In case you did something wrong, which for sure never happens ;), you can replace local changes using the command<br />
<code>git checkout -- &lt;filename&gt;</code><br />
this replaces the changes in your working tree with the last content in HEAD. Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept.</p>
<p>If you instead want to drop all your local changes and commits, fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it like this<br />
<code>git fetch origin</code><br />
<code>git reset --hard origin/master</code></p>
