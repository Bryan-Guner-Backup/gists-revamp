Many people ask me, "What can I do to take my HTML5 or JavaScript skills to the next level? There is only so much that you can learn in 60 minutes."

That's why we're excited to offer what we're affectionately calling "Cask-Strength HTML5 Training." Taught by Scott Davis (author of "Google Maps: Adding Where to Your Application"), David Geary (author of "Core HTML5 Canvas"), and Austin native Kyle Simpson (aka, "getify", and author of "HTML5 Cookbook"), these 1-day workshops are an opportunity for you to bring your laptop and your enthusiasm for in-depth training sessions.
