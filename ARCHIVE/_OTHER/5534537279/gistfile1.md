I've launched a kickstarter for a book series titled ["You Don't Know JS"](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getify/you-dont-know-js-book-series), to explore the "tough parts" of JS and help the language make more sense to developers who use it.

> You Don't Know JS" is an exploration of the mysterious, confusing, complex, and controversial parts of JavaScript.
>
> If you write JavaScript for your primary job, odds are, you're pretty good at it. But honestly, how well do you really know the language? Most of us, myself included, spend years writing JS and never really going beyond a surface understanding. And then we blame our WTF moments on "the bad parts".
>
> This book series will examine the things that trip up or confound even the most seasoned of JS devs. And I was one of them until (recently) I spent enough time poking at the tough parts to understand them. Now I want to help other devs have those "a-ha!" moments, too!
>
> What if you could really deeply know how JS works? Would that change how you view the language? I think so. Really, I do. A big part of why I love JS is that I finally "get it".

For any JS, HTML5, or general/other developer meetup that wants it, I will provide **3 free print copies** of _all the books in the series_. All I ask in exchange is that you **email and tweet and smoke signal to your meetup members** to let them know about [my Kickstarter funding campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getify/you-dont-know-js-book-series). That's it.

**Please help me spread the word** to build enough support/funding so that I can write all the titles in this series. I think it will help JS developers of all levels, from beginner to seasoned, to really deeply _know_ JS.

Here's a suggested tweet:

> "You Don't Know JS" (book series) kickstarter by @getify. http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getify/you-dont-know-js-book-series Help it get funded and spread the word! #reallyKnowJS

Thanks again for your support and help getting the word out!
