* **Load CSS**
* **Load CSS without blocking**
* **Load CSS in parallel**

These 3 seem like unfair comparisons. A "JS Loader" loads JavaScript, that's it. The fact that some also do other things not related to loading JavaScript is not relevant.

Put another way, if you're going to list those 3, why not list these as well:

* **Load Images**
* **Load HTML**
* **Load video files**
* **Load audio files**
* **Load SWF files**
* **Load PDF files**
* ...

My point is that listing only "CSS loading" is arbitrarily extending the definition of what a "JS Loader" should do from "loading JavaScript" to "loading JavaScript **and** this one other file type we like, but not any other file types".

General file loading is a very different beast from loading JavaScript resources specifically.
