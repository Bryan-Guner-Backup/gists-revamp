## 10 easy steps: Running R/Python in the cloud

1) Log into GCP 
2) Create a project (if not done already), and log into <your project> from top of screen
3) Once logged into project, click on Compute Engine ("GCE") >> VM Instances from side ("Hamburger Bar")
4) Click on "Create Instance"
5) Complete below steps at a minimum:
	- name: <your GCE VM name>
	- zone: e.g. "us-west1-b" or <your zone name>
	- boot disk: Ubuntu 16.04 w/Size of 10gb or more
6) Click CREATE at bottom of "Create Instance" page. VM will automatically start and turn green when on.
7) Click on SSH tab, of started machine.

	Note: Can also log into machine from the inline command line via:
	gcloud compute --project <your project> ssh --zone "us-west1-b" <machine name>
	
8) Run below code to install current versions of R/Python within bash shell of VM

	# Install Anaconda
		sudo apt-get update 
		mkdir Downloads
		cd Downloads
		wget "https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh" -O "Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh"
		chmod +x Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
		sudo sh "Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh" -b
		cd $HOME
		sudo -s
		rm -r Downloads

	# Export Conda Path
		echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/anaconda3/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
		source ~/.bashrc
		
	# Create conda environment to work with Python
		conda create --name py35 python=3.5 
		source activate py35
		python # Then CTRL+Z exit
			> x = ['hello','world']; x[0] + " " + x[1] + "!!!"
			# Then CTRL+Z exit
		source deactivate pyenv

	# Create conda environment to work with a 'newer' version of R
	# Find newest here https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/r/linux-64/
		conda create --name r34 r=3.4.3 -y
		source activate r34
		R
			> x <- c("hello", "world")
			> paste0(x[1],' ',x[2],"!!!")


9) Check box on running machine, and click STOP button at top of page to turn off.
10) Jump up and down, and celebrate. You've just made a Python/R machine which is billed by the minute to run your cool ML projects in the cloud.
