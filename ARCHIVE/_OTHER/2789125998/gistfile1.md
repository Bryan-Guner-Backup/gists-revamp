Enhance.js and responsive images

## Brad Fairley
Why has the RICG been so adverse to even admitting there is an issue with the maintenance involved in the propsed 'picture' solution?

Given that the issue has been brought up a number of times, by a number of people, has been recognized as an issue by the whatwg, threads created on the CG, why has no one from the CG or 'picture' pushing club attempted to help in updating 'picture' or even attempted to spitball ideas in how to make it better for this use case?

Is it political? Laziness? Lack of experience in the use case described? All the above?

Should designers make nearly all sites responsive by default now or should we mention it to clients as an option (with additional costs for extra work)?

I was just curious how you guys view responsive, as an additional service or a new way of building websites that we should all adopt for future clients much like any other new techniques in design and development.

## Eric Steinborn
I maintain a website for my uncle's tree business, wadestreeservice.com (not looking for a plug, you dont have to read it aloud), recently he was contacted by supermedia.com a company that tries to treat web advertising like the yellowpages. Telling him things like "We'll list you on all the search engines"..... bullocks! So I told him to tell them no and that I'd research a better option for him to go with.
My question is: What service, if any do you guys use to maintain your advertising for clients? It seems daunting to me to do it all myself.
Thanks for any info you can give me

## Sebastian Hall
One thing that always pains me when designing websites is how ugly they are when loading. Images pop in, the page reflows and there are things like the dreaded flash of unstyled type etc.

Some websites (apple.com) renders really nicely with animations and fades.

What are some techniques to do this and when is it appropriate?

Are there any downsides of doing it?

i just heard episode 13 and looked up some of your blog recommendations.
There were a post about retina display and progressive jpg's.
Shame on me - i didn't know exactly what progressive jpg' were, so I looked it up...
My question is...Why don't we use them all the time?
I'm just building a responsive website with large background images and the progressive jpgs load much nicer (althought i've to start a big download besides that i remotly see the effect).
The option to switch to progressive is very well hidden in fireworks. ;-)
