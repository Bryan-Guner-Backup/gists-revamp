<h3>How To Tell</h3>

If you are looking at a blog post (or whatever) about Flexbox and you see
<code>display: box;</code> or a property that is <code>box-{*}</code>, you are
looking at the old 2009 version of Flexbox. If you are looking at a blog post
(or whatever) about Flexbox and you see <code>display: flexbox;</code> or the
<code>flex()</code> function, you are looking at an awkward phase in 2011 that
I'm not sure if any browsers implemented. If you are looking at a blog post (or
whatever) about Flexbox and you see <code>display: flex;</code> and
<code>flex-{*}</code> properties, you are looking at the current (as of this
writing) specification.
