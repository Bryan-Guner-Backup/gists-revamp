Here's how "grips" templating engine would handle it.

Some notes:

1. Some of the "grips" template tag syntax shown in this example:
     - `{$: "#id" }` defines a top-level template section by id.
     - `{$* ref }` defines a loop block to iterate over `ref`.
     - `{$= ref $}` includes the value of `ref`.
     - for define tags and loop tags, you can optionally have a | delimited
       list of assignment statements. (see `name` and `setting` assignments above)
     - any reference of a variable that is not scoped (prefixed) with `$.` or
       `_.` will automatically be treated as a "local variable" within that
       block. you can create local variables as much as necessary. (see `name`
       and `setting` variables above)
     - assignments can optionally use a ?: ternary operator. A special syntax 
       applies to the else clause: an empty string ("") expression is assumed if the
       else clause (`: ref`) is omitted.
     - a special syntax for assignment statements is when the LH of the assignment
       includes a set literal (like `checked['low','high'] = ...`), and the RH of
       the assignment is a ?: ternary expression. The example above
       (`checked['low','high'] = setting ? 'checked'`) roughly equates to:
       `checked['low'] = (setting === 'low') ? 'checked' : ''` and
       `checked['high'] = (setting === 'high') ? 'checked' : ''`. It basically is
       a pre-computation hash for the comparisons, where the comparison results can
       then be used in the template as an include. Since the conditional comparison
       has already happened before you include, it emulates the concept of a
       conditional include.
2. in expressions, `$` is how you reference the data structure in the current
   context.
3. in expressions, `_` is how you reference the current iterator in a loop.
     - `_.value` is the actual value of the current iteration (whatever data
       type it may be).
     - `_.key` is either the numeric index for an array iteration, or the string 
       property name for an object-property iteration.
     - `_.index` is the numeric index of the iteration (regardless of whether
       iterating over an array or object).
     - `_.even` is true for even (0,2,4,...) iterations.
     - `_.odd` is true for odd (1,3,5,...) iterations (iterations are 0-based).
4. Loops can iterate over arrays, objects, set literals (`['low','high']` as shown
   above), or range literals (which would look like `[3..7]`).
