# Goals

## Address the content better

- For instance, the gallery (http://css-tricks.com/gallery/) is pretty useless but I think there is some cool stuff there. I also have a ton to add to it. It needs to be more useful.
- For videos, it seems a bit weird to treat them exactly like a blog post. Is a video watcher a different type of viewer? Why aren't links to iTunes more findable on that page then any other?
- Literally make every bit of content more suited by its design

## Consistency

- There is plenty of pagination on the site, but it's treated differently everywhere.
- There are too many typography styles, doesn't feel as tight as other sites I've done more recently.
- TONS more consistency failures, fix them.

## Better cross-device treatment

- Can the site be actually faster on devices that need it to be? Responsive design + goodies like AjaxInclude non-essential bits.

## Better aesthetically

- I'm a better designer now, so that will help.
- But I'm still not super great. Looking to outsource some parts of the design to bring it up a level.

## Faster

- Whatever I can do with my front-end-foo to get it to load faster.
- As of June 2012, the homepage is:
  - 48 requests
  - 520k
  - 1.7s average load time (broadband)

## Increase traffic

- Traffic is to any website's success.
  - If the site is more attractive, more people might visit it.
  - If the site is faster, more people might visit it.
  - If the site is more useful, more people might visit it.
  - If it invites exploration more, pageview may go up.
  - If the content is better, more people will come back.
- May 28, 2012 - June 28, 2012
  - Visits: 2,339,342
  - Unique Visitors: 1,346,588
  - Pageviews: 4,826,917
  - Pages / Visit: 2.06
  - Avg. Visit Duration: 00:02:08
  - Bounce Rate: 68.02%

## Better monitization

- Don't over-do it with ads, but place them better.
- For instance, AdSense does really well in small doses because of international traffic.
- Maybe some lower priced AND higher priced zones, more inclusive
- Make it easier for advertisers to find information and display options (cross sell too?)

## The little big things

- Keep it fresh
- Have fun, be whimsical
- Do the unexpected
- Play with the cutting edge and experimental (it's called css-tricks)

## Build out the private access area

- No other new site sections other than this
