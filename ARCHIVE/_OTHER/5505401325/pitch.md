ConfKick makes it possible for individuals to sponsor confernces and meetups.

Members of the community can band together to put money towards sponsorship of a conference that would usually be out of an individual's budget.

This would be focused on providing as much value to the community as possible, tending towards enabling smaller events that couldn't otherwise happen rather than large, corporate sponsored conferences.

Why would someone want to pledge towards this?

* They cannot attend but would like to support the confernce
* They want to help out free meetups/hackdays that don't charge for entry but have running costs
* They like the work that the organisers are doing for the community and want to support them
* To promote themselves within the community

Rewards could also be offered by event organisers to encourage people to pledge such as t-shirts, stickers, early access to ticket sales or discounts.
