Need some geometry and/or trigonometry help, specifically with rotating points (about the origin) on a 2d cartesian coordinate graph. To set up the question, let's observe a few already known formulas. See this rough diagram/graph:

<img width="746" alt="rotation-drawing" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/150330/95689065-059bc900-0bd4-11eb-8577-548433fdcfe3.png">

In the graph, you'll see point **A**, and you'll also see points **B** - **F** that are all shown as rotations (about the origin) from **A**, given a specific angle (**θ**). All 6 line segments (from origin to points **A** - **F**) are the same length.

If the coordinates of **A (x0,y0)** are known, and the desired rotation angle **θ** (in the counter-clockwise direction) is known, the coordinates **(x1,y1)** of the new point (**B** - **F**) can readily be calcuated with these formulas:

```
x1 = x0 * cos(θ) – y0 * sin(θ)
y1 = x0 * sin(θ) + y0 * cos(θ)
```

Note that this assumes rotation counter-clockwise, so the angles for points **E** and **F** would have to be greater than 180 degrees, as opposed to the smaller clockwise angles (red arcs) shown.

----

But what if you already knew the coordinates of **A** and another point (like **B**), but didn't know the angle? You can actually compute that **θ** angle based on the fact that the two respective line segments, being the same length (**r**), actually form two equal sides of an isosceles triangle. See this diagram:

The formulas needed to find **base**, **height**, and then ultimately the angle **θ**, are:

```
base = sqrt( (x1 - x0)^2 + (y1 - y0)^2 )   // standard 2d cartesian distance:
height = sqrt( r^2 - (base^2 / 4) )
θ = 180 - ( 2 * arctan(2 * height / base) )
```

OK, that's great so far. But here's the problem/question I have. As computed above, **θ** will always assume a counter-clockwise rotation from one point (like **A**) to another.

What if, given the coordinates of any two points, the **θ** that comes out is headed in the wrong direction? In other words, what if we wanted to represent the rotation from **B** to **A** instead of **A** to **B**?

<img width="746" alt="rotation-drawing" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/150330/95689065-059bc900-0bd4-11eb-8577-548433fdcfe3.png">

In this case, let's say the above computations ended up with the angle **θ** between **A** and **B** being about 35 degrees, but for rotation from **B** to **A**, we need **θ** to be -35 degrees.

So, given the coordinates for any two points, how can I figure out whether the **θ** I've computed should be the positive one that came out, or if I should negate it?

Keep in mind, that the two points could be in any of the quadrants of the coordinate system. I could write a bunch of `if` statements for each of the different (16 I think?) permutations of where the two points could be located, but I would really like to express this with a simpler math property if possible.

I contemplated computing the slope of the segment between the two points and use the sign of the slope, but that doesn't seem to be workable. Then I thought maybe the x-axis angle for each point might tell me something about the relative position of each point? But I can't quite work this out.

Help!?
