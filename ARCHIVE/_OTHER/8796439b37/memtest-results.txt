On my 64bit mac, this process uses about 391mb of memory according to "Activity Monitor".

> node --expose-gc memtest2.js

By contrast, if I read in 3.1mm records nearly identical to those being generated, from a .json file,
this process fills up 1.5gb of memory quickly, then crawls to a halt, and takes a REALLY long time to 
get all the records finally pulled in (like hours).

What gives?
