comparison of my proposal for script preloading vs. jaffathecake's proposal. "ex1-getify" and "ex1-jaffathecake" compare implementations for a simple script loader with serial request-order executions. "ex2-getify" and "ex2-jaffathecake" compare implementations of a more complex/capable loader that supports "sub-groups" of ASAP execution order semantics, as well as rudimentary error detection with abort/pause of script executions.
