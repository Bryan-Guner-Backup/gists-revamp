These are some thoughts I posted on a g+ thread (https://plus.google.com/u/0/113862800338869870683/posts/eTRcUWiDWwo), mostly in rant response to the subject.

But these thoughts actually come from the body of content that I'm recently presenting in the talk "Browser versions are dead", whose slides are here:  https://speakerdeck.com/getify/browser-versions-are-dead

I will post a video to this talk as soon as one becomes available, but here's an intro/pitch video (~2min) which is a quick overview of what the talk is about: https://vimeo.com/46201036
