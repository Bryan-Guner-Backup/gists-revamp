I'm having a geometry problem, and I need help!

For reference, [here's the CodePen](https://codepen.io/getify/pen/LrZLZJ).

What I'm trying to do:

I want to call `drawRect(..)` with a canvas's context, and have it draw a rectangle as its coded to do.

I also want to be able to create another canvas which represents the 90-degree clockwise rotation of the first canvas. This second canvas actually has the reversed dimensions (width is height, height is width). I want to call the same `drawRect(..)` with that second canvas, and have it draw the rotated rectangle.

To be clear, I don't want to draw a different rectangle, I want to draw the same rectangle, but I want it to have been rotated in its drawing.

Requirements:

- `drawRect(..)` cannot be modified
- the values of `rectWidth` / `rectHeight` cannot be modified
- the second canvas actually has to be of the reversed dimensions and the drawing has to have been drawn to it after the rotation
- the rotation has to be programmatic through the canvas API, not through CSS/etc
- Before calling `drawRect(..)`, I need to be able to apply other transformations in addition to the rotation, such as flipping the drawing horizontally (via `translate(..)` and `scale(-1,1)`). In other words, after the rotation, the registration point needs to be back at 0,0 for subsequent transforms (if needed).
