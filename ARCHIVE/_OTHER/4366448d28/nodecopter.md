# NodeCopter Ideas

A brain dump of ideas for potential nodecopter projects

## Acurate position feedback from kinect

Watch a flying nodecopter using a kinect, allowing for a much more precise positioning system and tighter feedback loop.

## Flight recorder (and replayer)

Write all commands to a log file (or stream elsewhere) and allow replay of logs back to the copter again to repeat movements.

## Preprogram route using Logo syntax

Allow programming of a route in the Logo programming language: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language) and then replaying

## 3D representation of copter in 6 axis in webgl

Stream the gyroscope data back to a web and draw a 3d model of the copter in its real world position (tilt, rotation etc) in a web browser

## Streetview style mapping

Quite tricky, but could take snap shots from the camera and record with position, angle etc, and try to recreate an indoor streetview from them.

## Touch sensitive feelers

Attach some long feelers to all 4 corners, providing feedback when getting too close to any wall.

## Can a nodecopter fly upside down?

Is it possible to get a nodecopter to spin its rotors the other direction and fly upside down?

## stick to a wall

If rotors can be reversed, can they be used to create force to hold a nodecopter to a angled source or even a wall?

## Waltzing

Make one copter mimic another, and then have two waltz, as dancing partners

## Line Dancing

I've managed to get one copter dancing to music, why not 5 in a row?

## Attaching stuff to quadcopters

- Velco - for sticking to things and other quadcopters
- Mifi device - for much greater range over GSM/3G
- Lazers
