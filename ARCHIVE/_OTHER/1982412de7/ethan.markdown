## Aaron Bazinet (BA-zih-nae)
Now that it's been a while after publishing “Responsive Web Design”, is there any other bit of info or point that you wished you would have included or thought of beforehand?

To Chris and Dave: The show is really great, I hope you guys are able to do this for a long time. You both make hilarious jokes, and you know your stuff, so it’s all good fun and helpful at the same time.

## Bary Walsh
I'm working on my first proper responsive project. What's best practice to prevent hidden images from loading? They wouldn't be background images they're images loaded using the img tag through a service like gravatar. 

## Wesley Terry
I'm having a small issue with a responsive design and embedded tweets. I keep trying to get a class added to the div that is giving me issues.

I'm basically adding these to the sidebar of a project using initializer, and at iPad view it is creeping over onto the right. 

min and max width from twitter seem to be the problem. 

Here's a fiddle to show you what I'm talking about, and my try at a solution.

Am I just trying to do something that won't work. If so, a simple "yes dummy, stop trying this," works for me.
