So now, in the code snippets, we move the "*" from being cuddled up on the left, to the
"function" and "yield" keywords, to being cuddled up on the right, to the identifiers
or expressions. Why?

Because now, in the body text, when we go to talk about the "foo" generator, we can say
"*foo()", and likewise we can say "*bar()" for the generator version compared to just
"bar()" for the normal function type.

Now, pay close attention to all the inline references to "foo" and "bar", and how the "*"
being present or not is a visual clue to help the reader know if you're talking about
a generator or a function. "*" being present makes the body text a little clearer and
a little less confusing.

Moreover, it "fits" cohesively with the "yield" statement, too. "yield *bar()" matches
the body text referring to a "*bar()", as opposed to "yield* bar()" not as clearly
being a match.
