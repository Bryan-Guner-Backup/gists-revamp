So, the concern with the above approach is the many places where "foo()" and "bar()"
appear inline in the paragraph text. It is confusing while reading the text whether
"foo()" is referring to a generator or a regular function, and the same is true of
"bar()". It's especially pronounced with "bar()" since in this example, the second
snippet changes "bar()" from a function to a generator, so now it's harder to know
in the text if we mean the function or generator version of "bar()".

In other words, "bar()" needs some way to denote that it's a generator function to
distinguish it from "bar()" referring to a normal function call. The two being
identical is confusing to readers.
