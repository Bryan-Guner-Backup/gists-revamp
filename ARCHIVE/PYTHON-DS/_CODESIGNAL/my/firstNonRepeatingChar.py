"""
*** First not repeating character ***
-------------------------------------
Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

Example

For s = "abacabad", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'.

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = '_'.

There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.
"""

s = "abacabad"


1. We iterate over the string.
2. We check if the current character is in the rest of the string.
3. If itâ€™s not, we return it.
4. If it is, we continue to the next character.



def firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in s[i + 1 :] and s[i] not in s[:i]:
            return s[i]

    return "_"
